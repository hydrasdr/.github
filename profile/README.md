### Setup for Windows, GNU/Linux, macOS and Android

1. **Connect the device**
   Connect the HydraSDR RFOne to your computer using the **USB-C to USB-A cable included with the HydraSDR RFOne**.

   > For Android, connect via an **OTG adapter** that supports **USB 2.0 High Speed** and provides **power**.

2. **Attach the antenna**
   Connect your antenna to the **ANT** port.

   > The port uses an SMA female connector; your antenna must have an SMA male connector.

3. **Install SDR++**
   
   Download the [HydraSDR SDR++ fork](https://github.com/hydrasdr/SDRPlusPlus/releases/tag/nightly) for your operating system and install it.

4. **Launch and configure**
   
   Open SDR++, select **HydraSDR RFOne** as the device, then set your desired sample rate and gain

   > **Tip:** A gain setting of **Linear 12** is a good starting point.
